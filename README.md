# \<Angry Bees\>: Game Design Document

## Vision Statement
The player will play as a greedy bear that wants to steal honey from a bee-hive. Join Justin BeeBear as he goes among the bees and pretends to be one so that he can steal their honey. 

## Gameplay 
What will game play entail:

### Mechanics
The player will have to go about tasks and anwser questions carefully so that they don't rise suspecision from the Bees.
These tasks will be mini-games where if the player fails to do so correctly, they will raise the bees suspicion. If the bees become too suspicious, they will confront the player and chase them out of the hive. The player will need to carefully interact with the hive if they are to successfully steal the honey. 

### Scoring and/or Win / Lose Conditions
The player will win the game if they're able to escape the hive with the honey or escape the hive alive if found out. The player will lose if the player dies. 

### Controls
The player will control the bear by using WASD/arrow keys and using space for actions. 
### Aesthetic
The aesthetics of the game will be in pixel art which will hugely depict the inside of a beehive.

### Desired Player Experience
The desired player experience is to build slight tension as the player is trying to blend in with the other bees without getting caught. They should have fun with mini-games and the slight randomness.

### Mini-Games
#### Collecting Pollen
Justin BeeBear will need to go outside of the hive and collect plenty of pollen to bring back to the hive so that he can past through. Pollen will be stored and latered sorted. The player will need to go up to flowers and shake it so that they can make the pollen fall down the ground. If the player cannot collect enough pollen, it will rise the suspicion meter.
#### Sorting Pollen
Once the pollen is grabbed the player will have to sort the pollen. This will be done by sorted the pollen by a discard and approved box. This will be determined by the pollen's color. If the player makes a mistake more than twice, the suspicion music will raise. 
#### Flying through the Hive
The player will have to navigate the hive by flying... flappy bird style. He will have to try and make it through if he cannot, he will rise the suspicion.
#### Random Triva
## Game Characters
### Justin BeeBear
Justin is a bear that recently got his hands on some top secret technology that shrinks him down to bee size
### The Bees
The bees are various little honeybees that are focusing on their hive and looking out for any suspicious looking individuals.

## Story
Justin BeeBear wants some honey and doesn't want to get stung by the bees. So he decided to take matters in his own hands and blend with the many bees of local hives so that he can take all the honey he wants. Once in he will have to collect pollen to prove that he is a bee. Once he collects the pollen, he will have to sort through it to make sure only high quality pollen is used to make honey. 

Once done, the bees will believe that he is a proper bee and can roam free. From there he will have to be careful raising suspicion as bees will talk to him and notice he is different. Once Justin passes their test, he will be able to collect the best honey in the hive and escape. 

## The Game World
### Outside
The player will briefly be outside to collect pollen. It will include flowers where Justin the Bear can grab and will just be a simple flower field. 
### In the Hive
The Hive will be the largest part of the game. The hive will appear mainly made out of honeycomb. It will be filled with plenty of bees that are flying around. 
  
## Media List
The art assets will be only pixel art. The current color scheme will be filled with a lot of browns and yellows.

### Music
There will be some ambient music that is using and slowing down the track of Flight of the Bumblebee. There are plans to have more upbeat music while the player plays.
When the player is getting chased, the music will be intense and while the player is doing mini-games, it will be upbeat and bee-ceful.
